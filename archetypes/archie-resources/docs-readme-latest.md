{{project}}
===========

This is boilerplate code generated by archie code scaffolding system based on the `{{archetype}}` archetype.

Configuarion and building
-------------------------

Configuration and building follows the standard CMake way.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Testing
-------

For testing, configuration needs to have the `ENABLE_TESING` option enabled. Test compilation is excluded from the `all` target. So a pseudo target `test-build` is provided to compile tests. Tests can be run using ctest.

```bash
cmake -DENABLE_TESING=ON ..
make test-build
ctest
```

Profiling
---------

For coverage reports, configuration needs to have the `ARCHIE_COVERAGE` option enabled. The code snippet below shows coverage over the unit tests, however coverage report may be generated over any executed binary. To see the coverage report, invoke the pseudo target `coverage`.

```bash
cmake -DARCHIE_COVERAGE=ON ..
make test-build
ctest
make coverage
```

Documentation generation
------------------------

API documents are generated using Doxygen. If Doxygen installation is detected by CMake, the `docs-doxygen` target will be available.

You can also generate additional documentation using sphinx. For that python, sphinx, breathe (plugin for sphinx) and myst (plugin for sphinx) needs to be installed. If the required dependencies are installed, `docs-sphinx` target will be available.
